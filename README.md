### 👋 Hello there!

I'm Ramil (Rah-mill), and I design for the Code to Cloud team. We're responsible for making tools that allow developers to build, test, run, publish, deploy, and scale their work. I'm currently leading design for GitHub Packages and Pages.

- Previously, I was a Product Design Director at 🎮 Xbox working on game dev tools.
