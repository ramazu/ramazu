### 👋 Hello there!

I'm Ramil (Rah-mill), and I design for the Code to Cloud team. We're responsible for making tools that allow developers to build, test, run, publish, deploy, and scale their work. I'm currently leading design for GitHub Packages and Pages.

Other things:
- 🍣 I'm an amateur sushi chef.
- 🎨 I've dabbled in pretty much everything from logos and apparel, to building out random web apps.
- 🎮 Previously, I was a Product Design Director at Xbox working on game dev tools.
- ✍🏼 I enjoy writing about my successes and failures. Here is[ a sample](https://uxdesign.cc/5-tips-to-design-meaningful-product-features-with-speed-and-efficiency-3222d8f728d6).
