### ðŸ‘‹ Hello

I'm Ramil, and I design for the Code to Cloud team. We're responsible for making tools that allow developers to build, test, run, publish, deploy, and scale their work. I'm currently leading design for GitHub Packages and Pages.

- Previously, I was a Director @ ðŸŽ® Xbox working on game dev tools (joining via [aquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/29/microsoft-buys-cloud-gaming-startup-playfab-to-bolster-its-azure-gaming-platform/)).
- I enjoy writing about my successes and failures. Here is[ a sample](https://uxdesign.cc/5-tips-to-design-meaningful-product-features-with-speed-and-efficiency-3222d8f728d6).
